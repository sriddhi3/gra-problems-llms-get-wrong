You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host asks you 'Do you want to pick door No. 2 instead?' Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?",
        "human_answer": "It is not an advantage to switch. It makes no difference if I switch or not because no additional material information has been provided since the initial choice."

        "question": "You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver. Your opponent puts in five bullets, spins the chambers and fires at himself, but no bullet comes out. He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing at you. Should he spin again?",
        "human_answer": "Yes, you should ask him to spin again. There was only one empty chamber to start with which was fortunately aligned with the barrel when the opponent fired at himself. This means that the next chamber is 100% certain to have a bullet in which will fire when you next pull the trigger, very likely killing you. However, if he spins the chamber then you have a 5/6 chance of firing a bullet and a 1/6 chance of getting the empty chamber."
