      "ANSWER\n",

      "\n",
      "1. We have 6 horses and need to determine their relative speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In one race, we can only compare 6 horses at a time. After this race, we would know the order of these 6 horses, but this isn't enough to definitively determine the fastest horse overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. After the first race, we know the top 3 horses. The fastest horse must be among these top 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. We need one more race with these top 3 horses to determine which among them is the fastest overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Therefore, we need a minimum of two races:\n",
      "   - First race: All 6 horses\n",
      "   - Second race: Top 3 horses from the first race\n",
      "\n",
      "6. With these two races, we can definitively determine which horse is the fastest among all 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. No additional races are needed, and we can't determine the fastest with fewer than two races.\n",
      "\n",
